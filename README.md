# Predict-News-Category

I have used dataset provided by machine hack.

I am using Natural Language Processing here.

There are four categories in the dataset(Politics, Technology, Entertainment, Business)
My task is to look at the provided news text, and predict in which category does it fall.

I started to work on this problem by eliminating punctuations and stop words, and then performing leemitization.
I trained the data using naive-bayes classifier, and then applied it to test set.
